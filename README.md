# Road-Accident-Analysis
![logo]()
To create a "Road Analysis" project in Power BI, using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, the following steps can be summarized:

1. **Data Collection (Excel/SQL):**
   - Collect relevant data from sources such as government traffic departments or open data portals. These could include road types, traffic volume, accident reports, road 
      conditions, and infrastructure details.
   - The data can either be imported from SQL databases or managed in Excel. SQL can be used to extract and clean data from relational databases, while Excel may house 
       smaller datasets or allow for manual input.

2. **Data Preparation and Cleaning (SQL/Excel):**
   - Use SQL for data wrangling—writing queries to join, filter, and aggregate data from different tables, ensuring the data is in a usable format. 
   - In Excel, any smaller datasets can be cleaned and formatted, including removing duplicates, handling missing values, and creating summary tables where needed.

3. **Data Import in Power BI:**
   - Import the cleaned data into Power BI. This may involve loading Excel files or connecting to SQL databases for direct data queries.

4. **Data Modeling:**
   - Create relationships between data tables to ensure the accuracy of insights in Power BI. Use Power Query to further transform and enrich data if needed.

5. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - Design the dashboard in Power BI to visualize key metrics such as accident hotspots, average daily traffic, road quality analysis, and trends over time.
   - Use charts like bar graphs, line graphs, maps, and KPI indicators for better insights.

6. **Publishing and Sharing:**
   - Share the dashboard with stakeholders to help in decision-making for road improvements and safety measures.
